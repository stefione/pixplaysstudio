        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile games published by PixPlays Studio on Android and iOS.
        </p>
        <p>
          PixPlays Studio is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information our games collect, how it is used, and the rights available to players.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

        <h4>1.1 No Personal Data Collected by Us</h4>
        <p>
          Our games do not directly collect or store any personal information such as your name, email, address, or contact details.
        </p>

        <h4>1.2 Third-Party Account Login</h4>
        <p>
          Some games allow players to create accounts or sign in using third-party identity providers such as:

          <li>Google Sign-In</li>
          <li>Apple Sign-In</li>
        </ul>

          These services may share essential authentication data with us (such as a user ID) so that your account can function. We do not collect or view additional personal details beyond what is necessary for login.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Device Data & Usage Data</h3>
        <p>

        <h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>

        <h3>6. Data Storage & Retention</h3>
